Book Buying and Selling App : BookLenDen
===================================

This app takes input from user as book details and then shows these details.
Next, the added books will be removed form the list when they are bought.
The user signin and signup are handled using Google Firebase database.

The singup required authentication. Email based authentication is used.
The signin step will not start untill verified.

The book data being added and deleted in the app are static and are maintained using sqlite database.
The app works with a buyer and seller view since you can add book in the list for selling and buy them from the list.

You can update the code with changes starting from changing the firebase database of your own project.
Also there is still many scope of improvement staring from authentication and signup to using realtime database for books.
